My name is Keenan Hye, and I am intensely interested in the interactions of art and science within the music production process.

I grew up playing saxophone, and am now primarily a guitarist and vocalist for [Yohannes](http://whoisyohannes.com/). I thrive writing original music, and love to accentuate my music through subtleties in the recording, mixing, and mastering process.


My desire to learn more about the scientific aspects of music production gave rise to my interest in signal processing and acoustics, and how the two fields can interact creatively with music. I am currently a candidate for a Masters of Engineering in Acoustics at Penn State University, and have a strong desire to apply acoustic principles to audio signal processing effects and create new, easy to use software tools for music producers and musicians.

For now, you can find a listing of my past experiences in my [work portfolio](/#blog)

In between classes at PSU, I am available as both a mastering engineer and an independent tutor for undergraduate engineering students in Boston - [you can reach out to me here for mastering.](https://getmastered.com) and [here for tutoring.](https://goo.gl/kugifU)
