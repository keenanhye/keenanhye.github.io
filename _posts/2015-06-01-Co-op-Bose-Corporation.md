During my time at Bose, I was fortunate to be working on an independent feasibility study on an adaptive equalization algorithm.

The algorithm would, in essence, compensate for measured abnormalities in a given listening room via output filtering. I was tasked with creating the algorithm and then testing it to see if such a system was feasible with limited involvement from the user.

I also made a room-response visualizer during my time there, which looked like this:

Working at Bose allowed me to learn various technical skills important to audio signal processing and acoustics, as well as improve my independent project management and data analysis skills.

### Technical Skills Acquired

Some notable technical skills I learned at Bose include the following:

- Acoustic room response measurement via MATLAB
- Implementation of digital FIR/IIR filters via MATLAB
- Frequency domain analysis of measured test signals
- Empirical research and data analysis via MATLAB and Excel
- GUI design via MATLAB
- Feasibility test design and implementation
