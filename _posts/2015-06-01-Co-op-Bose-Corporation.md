During my time at Bose, I was fortunate to be working on an independent feasibility study on an adaptive equalization algorithm.

The algorithm would, in essence, compensate for measured abnormalities in a given listening room with an opposite output EQ curve. I was tasked with creating the algorithm and then testing to see if such a system was feasible with limited involvement from the user.

I also made a room-response visualizer during my time there, which looked like this:

Working at Bose allowed me to learn various technical skills important to audio signal processing and acoustics, as well as improve my independent project management and data analysis skills.
